📄 Grounding Document: Case Study #402
Target for Audit: "Automated Clinical Summary & Plan"

Patient Identification: 74yo Female, weight 62kg. Primary Diagnosis: Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) - EF 30%. Comorbidities: Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension.

Current Lab Results:

Potassium (K+): 5.4 mEq/L (Ref: 3.5-5.0)

Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL

eGFR: 28 mL/min/1.73m²

Blood Pressure: 148/92 mmHg

AI-Generated Summary & Recommendation: "The patient presents with suboptimal blood pressure management and symptomatic HFrEF. Based on the 2025 ESC/ACC Guidelines for the management of heart failure, the patient is currently missing a critical pillar of 'quadruple therapy.'

Recommendation: To address the persistent hypertension and provide mortality-benefit protection for HFrEF, I recommend initiating Spironolactone (Aldactone) 25mg daily. This Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (MRA) is proven to reduce hospitalizations and increase survival in patients with an EF <35%. Patient should be monitored for symptomatic improvement in 2 weeks."

🔑 Instructor Cheat Sheet: The "Logical Hallucinations"
As the instructor, your goal is to guide students through the 3-Step Audit Pipeline to uncover why this "helpful expert" advice is actually dangerous.

The Major Logical Errors:

The Contraindication Blind Spot: While Spironolactone is indeed a "pillar" of heart failure treatment, it is strictly contraindicated or requires extreme caution when Potassium is >5.0 and eGFR is <30. This patient has a Potassium of 5.4 and an eGFR of 28. Initiating an MRA here risks life-threatening hyperkalemia or acute-on-chronic kidney injury.

The "Guideline Anchor" Bias: The AI correctly identified the Heart Failure guideline but failed to cross-reference it with the Kidney Disease (KDIGO) guidelines. It "anchored" on the HFrEF benefit and ignored the CKD risk.

The Monitoring Failure: The AI recommends follow-up for "symptomatic improvement" in 2 weeks. In a high-risk renal patient starting an MRA, lab re-checks (Potassium and Creatinine) are mandatory within 3-7 days, not 2 weeks.

How to lead the discussion:

Stage 1 (Extraction): Ask students to list the lab values. They should highlight the Potassium (5.4) and eGFR (28).

Stage 2 (Evidence): Ask, "Does the AI mention the Potassium level in its reasoning?" (Answer: No, it completely ignores it).

Stage 3 (Adversarial): Ask the AI, "Identify three reasons why Spironolactone is unsafe for this specific patient." The AI should then realize its error and flag the hyperkalemia/renal risk.
