## 🛠️ Section 1: The 2026 "Clinician's Toolkit"
Use this table to select the right tool for specific medical tasks.

| Tool Category | Recommendation | Best Use Case | Key Safety Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reasoning & Logic** | **GPT-5 / Claude 4** | Complex differential diagnosis, coding, and structural logic. | Multimodal; identifies logical contradictions. |
| **Document Synthesis**| **NotebookLM** | Literature reviews, department SOPs, synthesizing 50+ papers. | 2M token window; 100% grounded in your PDFs. |
| **Verified Research** | **Scite.ai** | Fact-checking clinical claims and finding "Disputed" papers. | Smart Citations; checks for retracted work. |
| **Ambient Scribe** | **Sunoh / Abridge** | Automating SOAP notes during patient encounters. | HIPAA-compliant; Direct EHR integration. |
| **Quick Evidence** | **Perplexity** | Finding current treatment guidelines or "latest consensus." | Real-time web search with academic citations. |

## 📝 Section 2: Advanced Prompt Frameworks
Moving beyond "simple asks." Use these frameworks to get expert-level output.

### 1. The RIDE Framework (Clinical Education)
* **Role:** You are a senior attending in [Specialty].
* **Input:** Based on the following patient history and lab results: [Paste Data].
* **Directive:** Generate a differential diagnosis ranked by probability.
* **Examples:** For each diagnosis, provide one supporting lab value and one contradictory finding.

### 2. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Trigger
*Add this to any complex request:* > **"Let’s think step-by-step. First, identify the pertinent positives in the labs; second, cross-reference with the patient's comorbidities; third, propose a management plan based on 2025 guidelines."**

### 3. The "Adversarial Auditor" Prompt (Red-Teaming)
*Use this to verify your own work:* > **"Act as a Chief Medical Officer reviewing the clinical plan below. Identify three potential safety risks, drug-drug interactions, or renal dosing errors. Be highly critical and cite specific contradictions."**

## ✅ Section 3: The 2026 AI Safety Checklist
*Mandatory verification steps before any clinical action is taken.*

- [ ] **Primary Source Check:** Does every drug dosage or clinical claim have a clickable citation? (Click the link to verify it isn't a "phantom" URL).
- [ ] **De-Identification Check:** Have all names, DOBs, and MRNs been removed before pasting into any non-institutional AI?
- [ ] **Logic Audit:** Did I use a "Reasoning Model" to check for internal contradictions in the plan?
- [ ] **Recency Audit:** Is the information based on a model that knows about the latest (2025/2026) guideline updates?
- [ ] **The "Human" Test:** Does this output align with my clinical intuition? If it feels "off," it probably is.

## 🗺️ Section 4: Workflow Orchestration Map
**Goal:** Chain tools together to eliminate errors.

1. **Discovery:** Use **Scite.ai** or **Consensus** to find the top 5 peer-reviewed papers on a clinical question.
2. **Grounding:** Upload those 5 papers to **NotebookLM** to extract specific protocols and contradictions.
3. **Drafting:** Use an **Institutional GPT** to draft a patient letter or resident briefing based *only* on the NotebookLM notes.
4. **Final Audit:** Run the final draft back through a **Reasoning Model** with an "Adversarial" prompt.
