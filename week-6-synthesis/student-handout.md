# Week 6: Building Your 2026 AI Workflow
## Student Handout & Series Wrap-Up

## 🔬 Tool Spotlight: Scite.ai
In 2026, Scite is the gold standard for **Verifiable Research**. It doesn't just predict text; it looks at the 1.4 billion citations in its database to see how the scientific community reacted to a paper.

**Key 2026 Features:**
- **Smart Citation Reports:** See instantly if a paper has been "Disputed" by newer research.
- **Reference Check:** Upload your manuscript before submission. Scite will tell you if any of your references have been retracted or are considered controversial.
- **Assistant Parallelism:** Ask a complex question, and the AI now searches multiple databases simultaneously for a faster, cited response.

## 🛠️ Orchestration: The "Expert Pipeline"
Don't rely on one tool. Professional AI users in 2026 chain tools together to eliminate errors.

### Standard Workflow Template:
1.  **Verification (Scite/Consensus):** Use to find *evidence* and check for retractions.
2.  **Synthesis (NotebookLM):** Use to *organize* your specific PDFs and notes.
3.  **Drafting (Custom GPT):** Use to *structure* the final output (e.g., a grant proposal or patient letter).

## 🏥 The Rise of Clinical Agents
The EHR is no longer a static database. 2026 has introduced **Grounded Clinical Agents**:
- **Transparent Citations:** Tools like "Chart Hero" and "OpenAI for Healthcare" now tie every clinical statement directly to a source in the patient’s chart or a peer-reviewed guideline.
- **Proactive Interventions:** "Agentic" AI can now draft care adjustments for a physician to review, moving from reactive to proactive care.

## 🏠 Final Take-Home Assignment: "The 2026 Workflow Map"
**Task:** Create a one-page "Workflow Map" for a task you perform at least once a week.

1.  **Select a Task:** (e.g., Weekly Literature Review, Case Presentation Prep, or IRB Submission).
2.  **Identify the Tools:** Which AI will you use for **Discovery**, **Verification**, and **Drafting**?
3.  **Build the Audit Step:** Where in your workflow will you perform the "Red Team" audit (from Week 4) to ensure the final output is safe?
4.  **Final Goal:** Bring this map to your next department meeting to share how you've optimized your productivity.
