## 🎯 The Big Picture: From Tools to Systems

Over the past five weeks, you've learned individual skills:
- **Week 1-2:** Which tools exist and how they differ
- **Week 3:** How to communicate effectively with them
- **Week 4:** How to verify and audit their outputs
- **Week 5:** How to ground AI in your own knowledge base

**This week:** We integrate everything into a professional workflow system.

## 🔄 Orchestration: Multi-Tool Workflows

**What is Orchestration?**
Don't rely on one tool. Professional AI users chain tools together to eliminate errors and maximize reliability.

**The Three-Stage Pipeline:**
1. **Verification Stage (Scite/Consensus):** Use specialized tools to find *evidence* and check for retractions
2. **Synthesis Stage (NotebookLM):** Use to *organize* your specific PDFs and notes
3. **Drafting Stage (Custom GPT/Claude):** Use to *structure* the final output
4. **Audit Stage (Week 4's Red Team):** Verify critical claims before delivery

**Why This Works:**
- Each tool specializes in one task
- Verification happens at multiple stages
- Human oversight at critical junctions
- Built-in audit trail from source to final output

This prevents hallucinations by having each tool specialize in one task.

## 🔬 Tool Spotlight: Scite.ai
In 2026, Scite is the gold standard for **Verifiable Research**. It doesn't just predict text; it looks at the 1.4 billion citations in its database to see how the scientific community reacted to a paper.

**Key 2026 Features:**
- **Smart Citation Reports:** See instantly if a paper has been "Disputed" by newer research.
- **Reference Check:** Upload your manuscript before submission. Scite will tell you if any of your references have been retracted or are considered controversial.
- **Assistant Parallelism:** Ask a complex question, and the AI now searches multiple databases simultaneously for a faster, cited response.

## 🛠️ Orchestration: The "Expert Pipeline"
Don't rely on one tool. Professional AI users in 2026 chain tools together to eliminate errors.

### Standard Workflow Template:
1.  **Verification (Scite/Consensus):** Use to find *evidence* and check for retractions.
2.  **Synthesis (NotebookLM):** Use to *organize* your specific PDFs and notes.
3.  **Drafting (Custom GPT):** Use to *structure* the final output (e.g., a grant proposal or patient letter).

## 🏥 The Rise of Clinical Agents
The EHR is no longer a static database. 2026 has introduced **Grounded Clinical Agents**:
- **Transparent Citations:** Tools like "Chart Hero" and "OpenAI for Healthcare" now tie every clinical statement directly to a source in the patient’s chart or a peer-reviewed guideline.
- **Proactive Interventions:** "Agentic" AI can now draft care adjustments for a physician to review, moving from reactive to proactive care.
**The "Human Escape Hatch" Principle:**
As AI becomes more autonomous, human oversight becomes MORE critical, not less.

**Required Safeguards:**
1. **Transparent Sourcing:** Every recommendation must cite its source
2. **Confidence Scoring:** Agent indicates certainty level
3. **Human Approval:** No autonomous execution of critical actions
4. **Audit Trail:** Complete record of reasoning process
5. **Fail-Safe Defaults:** When uncertain, escalate to human

**Remember:** Use agents as research assistants, not decision makers. You remain responsible for all clinical decisions.

## 🏠 Final Take-Home Assignment: "The 2026 Workflow Map"
**Task:** Create a one-page "Workflow Map" for a task you perform at least once a week.

**Part A: Design Your Workflow**
1. **Select a Task:** (e.g., Weekly Literature Review, Case Presentation Prep, or IRB Submission)
2. **Define Input/Output:** What do you start with? What do you need to deliver?
3. **Map the Three Stages:**
   - **Verification:** What tool will find/verify evidence? (Scite/Consensus/PubMed)
   - **Synthesis:** What tool will organize your information? (NotebookLM/Claude)
   - **Drafting:** What tool will create final output? (Custom GPT/Claude/GPT-5)
4. **Build the Audit Step:** What will you verify manually? What red flags will you watch for?
5. **Identify Human Decision Points:** Where is your judgment non-negotiable?

**Part B: Test & Refine**
- Run your workflow at least twice
- Note what works and what breaks
- Iterate and improve
- Track time saved and quality improvements

**Part C: Share & Contribute**
- Bring your workflow map to next department meeting
- Share what you learned
- Help colleagues adapt for their needs
- Contribute to institutional knowledge base

**Bonus Challenge:**
- Build a Custom GPT for your most common task
- Create reusable prompt templates
- Train a colleague on one tool you've mastered
