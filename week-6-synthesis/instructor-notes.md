# Week 6: Orchestration & The Professional AI Workflow
## Instructor Notes (2026 Final Session)

---

### Slide 1: The Final Pillar: Orchestration
**Title:** From Tools to Systems: Building Your Professional Workflow
**Context:** We’ve learned prompting, red-teaming, and grounding. Today, we tie them together into a high-speed research and clinical pipeline.

**Speaker Notes:**
- "2024 was the year of the chatbot. 2026 is the year of the Agent."
- Today we move from asking one AI a question to building a workflow where multiple AIs verify each other.

### Slide 2: Scite.ai – The Verification Engine
**Concept:** Moving from "Generative" to "Verifiable."
- **GPT-5.2 Integration:** Scite Assistant now uses healthcare-optimized models for superior reasoning.
- **Smart Citations:** 1.4B+ citations now indexed, showing if a paper is supported or disputed.
- **Reference Check:** Upload your draft and Scite will scan your bibliography for retracted or heavily disputed papers automatically.

### Slide 3: Example 2026 Workflow: The "Clinical Deep Dive"
**Step 1: Discovery (Scite/Consensus):** Find the current consensus on a rare drug interaction.
**Step 2: Grounding (NotebookLM):** Upload the top 5 papers found in Step 1 to extract specific dosage protocols.
**Step 3: Synthesis (Claude/GPT-5.2):** Draft a department briefing based *only* on the verified sources.

### Slide 4: "Agentic" Healthcare Workflows
**Trend:** AI is moving into the EHR (Electronic Health Record).
- **Chart Hero (Penn Medicine):** AI that sifts through patient data and suggests courses of action with one-click access to the source material.
- **Ambient Scribes:** Adoption of tools like Sunoh.ai has grown 320%—converting patient visits into structured notes automatically.

### Slide 5: Final Demo: The "Full Pipeline" (15 Mins)
**Instructor Action:** Perform a live search in Scite Assistant.
1. Ask: *"What is the consensus on GLP-1 agonists for neuroprotection?"*
2. Show the **"Consensus Meter"** (Consensus.app) or **Smart Citations** (Scite).
3. Take the citation snippets and move them into a **Custom GPT** designed to format abstracts for your specific journal.

---

### Slide 6: Series Wrap-Up & Ethics Check
- **Verification is non-negotiable:** In 2026, we never use an un-cited AI statement for clinical decisions.
- **The Human Escape Hatch:** As workflows become more "Agentic" (autonomous), the human clinician's role as the final auditor is more critical than ever.

## Teaching Tips
- **Celebration:** Congratulate the cohort! They now have a more advanced AI toolkit than 95% of their peers.
- **Resource Pack:** Provide the "Prompt Library" and "Tool Comparison Guide" as a parting gift.
